# TruVoice: parameter generator

How L&H TruVoice (`tv_enua.dll`) turns timed phonemes into frames for its synthesizer. For each phoneme or pause the parameter generator works out what each of the 22 tracks of a frame should do ([synthesizer.md](synthesizer.md) §4.1), and writes the phoneme's frames into the synthesizer's ring ([synthesizer.md](synthesizer.md) §5.1), rewriting the end of the previous phoneme's where the two blend.

This spec covers the tracks, and how the generator writes them (section 2). The targets, the rules and their actions, the vowel database and the stage's driver are still to come.

**In short.**
- The generator works track by track. For each phoneme it fills in a **segment** for each track: a mode, how many frames, an onset and a target, two shapes, and a value to pull the previous phoneme's last frames toward. Rendering the segment writes the phoneme's frames of that track.
- A segment's values are in the track's units (Hz for the formants and bandwidths, the frame byte for the amplitudes) and become frame bytes by a shift. Frame bytes wrap around; nothing is clamped.
- Transitions follow 31 fixed shapes: decaying weights from 255 down, one per frame.
- After each phoneme every track moves on by its segment's frames. The ring's written frames end where the slowest track is, and the frame before it is marked for the output stage.

**Exactness.** Ported from the original's code, and checked against it by replaying every call of its track functions recorded in 140 runs (the ten voices, both rates, every speed range, pitch and volume tags, whisper, monotone, emphasis, tones and generated segments, texts spoken one after another in one session, long texts with a long pause, and 44 sentences chosen for their sounds): each of the 222,460 segments rendered (section 2.4), the stage's 124,149 direct writes into the ring (section 2.5), 10,100 advances (section 2.6) and 25,731 room checks and rebases (section 2.7) left the speaking thread's state byte-identical to the original's.

## 1. Arithmetic

All arithmetic is in 32-bit signed integers. Divisions truncate toward zero; shifts of negative numbers are arithmetic. The **Q15 product** of `a` and `b` is `a · b / 32767`. A value written into a frame is its low 8 bits.

## 2. Tracks

### 2.1 The tracks

The generator writes the synthesizer's ring ([synthesizer.md](synthesizer.md) §5.1): frame `p` of track `k` is byte `k` of slot `p mod 256`. For each track it keeps:
- `next`: the frame it writes next;
- `earliest`: the first frame it may still change. Frames before it may already be with the synthesizer;
- `last`: the value of the frame before `next`, in the track's units (section 2.2).

It also keeps `furthest`, the highest `next` of the tracks, and a `margin` of frames it keeps free in the ring.

### 2.2 Units

A track's values are in its units; a frame holds them as bytes:

| Track | Units | Byte of a value `v` | Value of a byte `b` |
|---|---|---|---|
| 9 (F1) | Hz | `v >> 2` | `b << 2` |
| 10 (F2) | Hz | `(v − 500) >> 3` | `(b << 3) + 500` |
| 11, 12 (F3, F4) | Hz | `v >> 4` | `b << 4` |
| 13, 14, 15 (B1, B2, B3), 17 (F0) | Hz | `v >> 1` | `b << 1` |
| 16 (FNZ) | Hz | `(v − 192) >> 2` | `(b << 2) + 192` |
| the others | the byte | `v` | `b` |

### 2.3 Segments

A **segment** is what the generator writes on one track for a phoneme. It has seven numbers:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `mode` | How the segment is written (section 2.4) |
| `back` | The shape of the pull on the frames before `next`, or how many frames a bridge reaches back |
| `forward` | The shape from the onset to the target, or how many frames a ramp or a bridge reaches forward |
| `frames` | The segment's length in frames |
| `back target` | The value the pull moves the frames before `next` toward |
| `onset` | The value the segment starts from |
| `target` | The value the segment moves to |

### 2.4 Rendering a segment

To render track `k`'s segment:

1. Convert `back target` and `onset`, both raised to 0 if negative, and `target` to bytes (section 2.2); keep their low 8 bits.
2. `room = next − earliest`. If `mode` is odd and `room < 1`, make it even.
3. Write by the mode, from `next` on (the writers are in section 2.5):

| Mode | Writes |
|---|---|
| 1 | pull back: `PullBack(next, back, room, back target)` |
| 2 | `PullForward(next, forward, frames, onset)` |
| 3 | pull back, then as mode 2 |
| 4 | `Fill(next, shape 0, frames, 0, target)`: `frames` frames of the target |
| 5 | pull back, then as mode 4 |
| 6 | `Fill(next, forward, frames, onset, target)` |
| 7 | pull back, then as mode 6 |
| 8 | `Ramp(next, forward, onset, target)` |
| 16 | `Bridge(next, back, forward)` |
| 20 | as mode 6, then as mode 16 |
| any other | nothing |

So modes 9, 17 and 21 write nothing, unless step 2 made them 8, 16 or 20. `next` doesn't move here: the advance does (section 2.6).

### 2.5 The ring writers

The writers work on one track of the ring. Shapes are lists of weights from the data pack ([datapack.md](datapack.md) §5): shape `s` has at most `s` weights, the first 255; shape 0 has none. Moving a frame byte `f` toward a byte `v` by a weight `w` gives the low 8 bits of `f + Q15(v − f, w · 128)`.

- `Fill(p, s, n, onset, target)`: frame `p + i` is `target` moved toward `onset` by weight `i` of the shape, for each weight while `i < n`; then frames up to `p + n − 1` are `target`. A negative `n` writes all the shape's weights and nothing more.
- `PullBack(p, s, n, v)`: frame `p − i` moves toward `v` by weight `i`, for each weight after the first, at most `n` frames.
- `PullForward(p, s, n, v)`: frame `p + i` moves toward `v` by weight `i`, for each weight, at most `n` frames.
- `Bridge(p, b, f)`: with `n = b + f`, `first` frame `p − b` and `last` frame `p + f`: frame `p − b + i` becomes `first + i · (last − first) / n`, for `i` from 0 to `n − 1`. The last frame stays.
- `Ramp(p, n, start, end)`: frame `p + i` becomes `start + (i + 1) · (end − start) / n`, for `i` from 0 to `n − 1`: the line starts after `start` and ends on `end`.
- `Repeat(p, n, v)`: frames `p` to `p + n − 1` become `v`.
- `AddBack(p, s, n, change)`: if the frame before `p` plus `change` is below 0, `change` becomes minus that frame. Then frame `p − i` becomes its value plus `Q15(change, w · 128)`, for each weight `w` after the first, at most `n` frames; on the amplitude tracks (0, 1, 2) a result of 0 or less is 0. The result's low 8 bits are written.

The generator's other functions call the writers too; their sections will say where. For a negative count, `Ramp` and `Repeat` don't stop in the original; the recorded runs never give one.

### 2.6 Advancing

After the generator has rendered a phoneme's segments, every track moves on:
1. `next` moves on by the segment's `frames`;
2. `last` becomes the value of the frame before the new `next`;
3. `earliest` becomes `next − lookahead` ([synthesizer.md](synthesizer.md) §5.1) if that is later.

Then the lowest `next` of the tracks becomes the ring's `written`, the highest becomes `furthest`, and the frame before `written` gets its marker bit. The marked frame of each phoneme or pause is thus the last frame every track has written for it, which the output stage counts ([pipeline.md](pipeline.md) §5).

### 2.7 Room and rebase

- The ring has **room** for `n` frames when `margin + furthest − position + n < 256`, with the synthesizer's `position`.
- **Rebase**: the synthesizer's rebase ([synthesizer.md](synthesizer.md) §5.1). If it moved its counters back, every track's `next` and `earliest` and `furthest` move back by 2048 too.

## 3. What the recorded runs don't reach

These follow the original's code, but no recorded run gets there:
- Segments of modes 2, 3, 9, 17, 21 or above 21. A pull forward comes only from the generator's direct calls.
- A negative `frames`, `back target`, `onset` or `target` in a segment.
- A Q15 product where dividing by 32767 instead of 32768 changes the result, as for `151 · 217 · 128`.
- `AddBack` taking a frame other than the first below 0, or a first frame plus `change` of exactly −1.
- A ring without room: the generator was at most 115 frames ahead of the synthesizer, margin included, because the synthesizer renders after every step of the generator.
